# About Me

Hello! I am an enthusiastic and driven individual who is passionate about programming, research, learning, and problem-solving. I strive to leverage my technical abilities and insatiable curiosity to tackle real-world challenges and make a positive impact through technology.

# My Loss Function

$MyLoss = D_{KL}(work||life) + patience * \left \| \left \| bugs \right \| \right \| _2$  

Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be a daunting task for anyone, especially for programmers who are constantly grappling with debugging issues. However, I am a firm believer in the power of patience and persistence. I know that with these qualities, I can overcome any obstacle and continue to grow as a professional.

# My Projects

Here you will find a selection of my most interesting projects. Some are related to my research, while others are just for fun. Regardless, I'm proud of all of them and I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed creating them.

## ðŸª» LILAC: Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization

LILAC is my latest research project that extends an offline VAEâ€“Diffusion motion stylization framework into a **real-time streaming system**. It achieves low-latency, long-sequence, and temporally consistent stylized motion generation through a causal decoding architecture. This method enables arbitrary motion stylization in real time, making it suitable for animation, avatars, and interactive systems.

The GIF below shows **long-sequence streaming stylization** results (all with trajectory copy to preserve spatial consistency for VR users): the **left** clip is the original motion, the **middle** shows real-time transfer among three styles (*old*, *open-leg*, *hands-high*), and the **right** continues the *hands-high* stylization sequence.

## ðŸŽ‰ Empowering the Visually Impaired with an Innovative Indoor Navigation App

Introducing my iPhone app, designed to provide reliable and accurate navigation assistance to visually impaired individuals navigating indoor spaces. Utilizing advanced particle filter technology and programmed in Swift, my app offers a dependable solution for indoor navigation challenges faced by those with visual impairments.

To see the full capabilities of my app, check out this [video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MvOaDDGPZ5dK3lg0F4zSvck8pdmtDzPl/view?usp=sharing). I'm excited to offer this tool to empower and enhance the independence of visually impaired individuals.
