### A programmer, a researcher, a learner, and most importantly, a problem solver.

Welcome to my github page! Here you will see a bunch of interesting repos. Though they are not necessarily related to my research, they are fun enough for me to waste my spare time on.

## ðŸ’¡ Deep learning projects

- [A_Pipeline_Of_Pretraining_Bert_On_Google_TPU](https://github.com/pren1/A_Pipeline_Of_Pretraining_Bert_On_Google_TPU)

  A very useful tutorial I wrote when I played around with Google's super fast TPU. Got 40 starts, yeah~!
