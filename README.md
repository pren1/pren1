Welcome to my GitHub page! 

Here you will find a bunch of interesting repos. Though they are not necessarily related to my daily research, they are fun enough for me to waste my spare time on.

## 💡 Deep learning projects

- [A Pipeline Of Pretraining Bert On Google TPU](https://github.com/pren1/A_Pipeline_Of_Pretraining_Bert_On_Google_TPU)

  A very useful tutorial I wrote when I played around with Google's super-fast TPU. Got 40 stars, yeah~!

- [MMD Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/pren1/keras-MMD-Variational-Autoencoder)
  
  A MMD-Variational-Autoencoder written in Keras.
- [Chinese Voice Synthesizer](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fS4y1k7C3/)
  
  ![Maintainer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chinese-only-blue)
  
  A Chinese voice synthesizer specially developed for several vtubers. 
- [VAST](https://github.com/pren1/VAST)
  
  A model that can separate mixed voices from two Japanese speakers.   
- [Artificial DD](https://github.com/pren1/Artificial_dd)
  
  ![Maintainer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chinese-only-blue)
  
  A software that can send context-based fake Chinese chat messages. You can check the video [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17J411n7Lx/). 

## 💻 Machine learning projects

- [Emoticon Descriminator](https://github.com/pren1/Fast_naive_bayes)
  
  A naive Bayes classifier that can discriminate emoticons.

- [Fans Kalman](https://github.com/pren1/fans_kalman)
  
  A Kalman filter is utilized to predict the fans of any vtuber.
## 📖 Class projects
- [Primary Type classifier](https://github.com/pren1/naive_bayes)

  A primary type classification based on Naive Bayes.

- [JPCT Demo](https://github.com/pren1/JPCT_demo)

  A well-documented face model render app on the Android platform.
